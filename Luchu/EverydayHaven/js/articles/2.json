Whether you have oily, dry, combination, or sensitive skin, each type requires a tailored approach to achieve optimal results.</p>\n            \n            <img src=\"image/3.png\" alt=\"Skincare products\">\n            \n            <h3>The Essential Steps</h3>\n            <p>A complete skincare routine consists of several key steps that work together to cleanse, treat, and protect your skin. Here's the optimal order:</p>\n            \n            <ol>\n                <li><strong>Cleanser:</strong> Start with a gentle cleanser suited to your skin type. This removes dirt, oil, and makeup without stripping your skin's natural barrier.</li>\n                <li><strong>Toner:</strong> A good toner helps balance your skin's pH and prepares it for better absorption of subsequent products.</li>\n                <li><strong>Serum:</strong> This is where active ingredients like vitamin C, retinol, or hyaluronic acid come into play. Serums penetrate deeply to address specific concerns.</li>\n                <li><strong>Moisturizer:</strong> Essential for all skin types, moisturizers lock in hydration and create a protective barrier.</li>\n                <li><strong>Sunscreen:</strong> Never skip this step, even on cloudy days. UV protection is the single most important anti-aging measure.</li>\n            </ol>\n            \n            <img src=\"image/4.png\" alt=\"Morning skincare routine\">\n            \n            <h3>Key Ingredients to Look For</h3>\n            <p>Understanding active ingredients can help you make informed choices about your skincare products:</p>\n            \n            <ul>\n                <li><strong>Hyaluronic Acid:</strong> A powerful humectant that can hold up to 1000 times its weight in water, providing intense hydration.</li>\n                <li><strong>Vitamin C:</strong> A potent antioxidant that brightens skin, fades dark spots, and protects against environmental damage.</li>\n                <li><strong>Retinol:</strong> The gold standard for anti-aging, retinol promotes cell turnover and collagen production.</li>\n                <li><strong>Niacinamide:</strong> Helps reduce inflammation, minimize pores, and improve skin texture.</li>\n                <li><strong>Peptides:</strong> Support collagen production and help maintain skin's firmness and elasticity.</li>\n            </ul>\n            \n            <h3>Professional Tips for Glowing Skin</h3>\n            <p>Beyond your daily routine, several lifestyle factors contribute to healthy, glowing skin:</p>\n            \n            <p>Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day. Your skin reflects your internal hydration levels. Get adequate sleep—your skin repairs itself during rest, so aim for 7-9 hours nightly. Manage stress through meditation, exercise, or hobbies, as stress can trigger breakouts and accelerate aging.</p>\n            \n            <img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1571875257727-256c39da42af?w=800&h=600&fit=crop\" alt=\"Healthy lifestyle\">\n            \n            <p>Remember, consistency is key. A skincare routine takes time to show results, so be patient and stick with your regimen. Most products need at least 4-6 weeks of consistent use before you'll see noticeable improvements.</p>\n        ",
